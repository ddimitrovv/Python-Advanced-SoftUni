# On the first line, you will receive a string of numbers separated by space.
# On the second line, you'll receive a target number. Your task is to find all pairs of numbers
# whose sum equals the target number.
# For each found pair print "{number} + {number} = {target_number}".
# Then, save only the unique pairs. Note: (1, 2) and (2, 1) are unique.
# Also, you should keep track of how many iterations you've done.
# At the end print all the iterations done in format: "Iterations done: {total_number_of_iterations}".
# On the following lines, print the unique pairs in the format: "(first_number, second_number)".
# The order in which we print the result does not matter.
